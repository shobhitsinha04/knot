## v0.1.6

Repository moved into the `freshgoldfish` GitHub org (co-owned by Keisha Kaba and Shobhit Sinha). Published so the updated `freshgoldfish/knot` repository URL, and the "Repository" link on the listing, go live. No functional code changes.

## v0.1.5

Added a "Built by Keisha Kaba & Shobhit Sinha" developer credit near the top of the README, rendered as plain Markdown so it displays consistently on GitHub and the Marketplace listing. Version bump to publish the updated README.

## v0.1.4

**Stylistic changes** to the README and the marketplace description. Copy-only; no functional code changes.

## v0.1.3

Marketplace listing polish:

- New README banner and refreshed intro copy.
- Added the long-form logo asset (`media/knot-logo-long.jpg`).
- Added the internal release runbook (`docs/RELEASING.md`).

## v0.1.2

Critical activation fix. The initial published `.vsix` shipped without its LanceDB / Apache Arrow runtime dependencies, so the extension failed to activate on install. Fixed by bundling `apache-arrow`, `flatbuffers`, and `tslib` (via `.vscodeignore`).

## v0.1.1

Initial public release. First publish of Knot AI to the VS Code Marketplace at the end of Phase 8.
